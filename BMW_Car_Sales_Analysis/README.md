# ðŸš— BMW Car Sales Analysis (2010â€“2024)

This project analyzes BMW car sales data from **2010 to 2024** across multiple regions. The goal is to uncover sales and pricing trends, identify key market insights, and **deep dive into the impact of the COVID-19 era (2020 onwards)**.  

The analysis demonstrates SQL skills such as:  
- **Aggregation** (SUM, AVG, COUNT)  
- **Joins** (fuel type mapping, region-based analysis)  
- **CTEs** (ranking models, market share)  
- **Subqueries** (cars priced above global average)  
- **UNION** (pre vs post COVID comparisons)  
- **CASE statements** (categorization into COVID-era and price bands)
